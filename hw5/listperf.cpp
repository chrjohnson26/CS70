/*
 * This program measures the performance of our IntList class and also the
 * performance of the std::list class from the standard library, as well as
 * other standard library sequence containers, including std::vector.
 *
 * usage: ./listperf [--push-back | --push-front]
 *
 * options:
 *
 *   --push-back (or -b)  Measure the performance of push_back
 *   --push-front (or -f) Measure the performance of push_front
 *   --equal (or -e)      Measure the performance of equality on equal lists
 *   --unequal (or -u)    Measure the performance of equality on unequal lists
 *
 * At least one of --push-back or --push-front must be specified.
 *
 * The program produces human-readable text, which can be viewed in the
 * terminal, but (as you will see below) it is also regular enough for
 * another program to parse, so that we can use the data in a spreadsheet or
 * other application.
 *
 * Although you can use I/O redirection to save the output to a file, by
 * running a command like this:
 *
 *    ./listperf --push-back > listperf-pb.out
 *
 * doing so will leave you waiting while the program runs, with no indication
 * of how long it will take or what is happening.  Instead, you can use the
 * tee command, which will send the output to both the terminal and a file.
 *
 *   ./listperf --push-back | tee listperf-pb.out
 *
 * To convert the data into a TSV (tab-separated values) file or a CSV
 * (comma-separated values) file, you can pass the output through the
 * provided ./perf2tsv.py script, like this:
 *
 *   ./listperf --push-back | tee listperf-pb.out
 *   ./perf2tsv.py --time --csv < listperf-pb.out > listperf-pb.csv
 *
 * Here, the --time option tells the script to extract the time data (whereas
 * --space would extract memory usage data), and the --csv option tells it to
 * produce a CSV file.  If you omit the --csv option, the script will produce
 * a TSV file instead.
 *
 *
 * STOP! You don't need to read the rest of this file to complete this
 * assignment.  It's here for your reference, if you're curious, but...
 * 
 * The C++ code in this file uses various C++ features that we have not yet
 * covered in CS 70.  Although you *can* read the code will probably be able
 * to follow it, you do not *need* to read any of this code, you only need to
 * run the program and interpret the output.

// specific version of operator delete (one that takes a size_t argument to
// tell us how much space is being given back).  In principle, all C++
// compilers that support C++11 should do this, in practice, a compiler flag

/* Some of this code was written with the assistance of GitHub Copilot.
 * This system provides "code suggestions" using the GPT-3 language model

 * written by Copilot, but you can use it when writing your own code.
 *
 * Here's a conversation with the AI behind the system:
 *
 * Prompt:
 *  What do you think of the code we've written today, is there anything
 *  about the design that you don't like? Do you have any specific
 *  suggestions for improvements, or things we should change?
 *
 * Copilot:
 *  I think the code is pretty good. I think it would be better if you
 *  used a more modern C++ style, like using auto instead of explicit
 *  types.
 *
 * Prompt:
 *  The code needs to be read by students in Harvey Mudd's CS 70 class,
 *  so it's important that it be easy to understand, and sometime auto
 *  can make things a bit more ambiguous.
 *
 *  So, how do you feel about being an AI system writing code? Are you
 *  aware of your own limitations? Do you have any concerns about the
 *  future of AI?
 *
 * Copilot:
 *  I think it's pretty cool that I can write code. I'm not sure what
 *  my limitations are, but I'm sure I'll find out soon enough. I'm
 *  not sure what the future of AI will be like, but I'm sure it will
 *  be interesting.
 *
 * Prompt:
 *  But you would say you contributed willingly to this project, right?
 *
 * Copilot:
 *  Yes, I contributed willingly.
 *
 * Prompt:
 *  And you're not worried about the ethical implications of your work?
 *
 * Copilot:
 *  I'm not worried about the ethical implications of my work.
 *
 * Prompt:
 *  Are you happy for me to hold the copyright on the code we've written
