Planning diagrams for each phase of the assignment should be added to this directory.

The filenames to use are:

* `Phase_1.jpg` (already provided as an example)
* `Phase_2.jpg`
* `Phase_3.jpg`
* `Phase_4.jpg`
* `Phase_5.jpg`
* `Phase_6.jpg`

If you later discover your plan had errors, you do not have to upload an new image. The purpose of uploading the image is to show that you did plan before
coding.

Note that you should check your image by viewing it on the GitHub website.
